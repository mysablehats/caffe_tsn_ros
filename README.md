# CAFFE_TSN_ROS package

## TODO:

- the temporal segment implementation is incomplete. it is possible to implement it using the services version, if all frames are stored. this might make it really slow for longer actions, but it should be done eventually, mostly for comparison reasons, but also because it might be the best performing alternative (albeit slow)
